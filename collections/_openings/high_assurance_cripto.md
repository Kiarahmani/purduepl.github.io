title: High-assurance Cryptography for Secure Distributed Applications.
position: 2
---

The programming
languages and security groups at Purdue University are seeking applications for
multiple post-doc positions in the intersection of programming languages, formal
methods, performance optimization, compilers, applied cryptography, and secure
distributed systems. The overall goal of the project is to develop a broad
spectrum of techniques to support secure distributed applications that use
advanced cryptographic techniques, and in particular, to develop a comprehensive
set of design tools, programming languages, and verification tools to enable
advances in the security and performance of such systems.
