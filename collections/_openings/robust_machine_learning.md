title: Formal Methods for Robust Machine Learning 
position: 2
---
The programming
languages and security groups at Purdue University are seeking applications for
multiple post-doc positions in the intersection of programming languages,
formal methods and machine learning. 
While there has been a great deal of success recently in the development of
machine learning methods and systems for real world applications, much of the
success has been in relatively restricted domains where there is (i) a clearly
defined task, with (ii) clearly defined measures of success, (iii) large amounts
of labeled training examples, (iv) limited structural variation, and (v) few
system constraints. This project is looking for a postdoc to work on building
more robust and efficient ML systems by using systems engineering principles and
practices to improve the deployment of ML systems, and developing foundational
methodology, analysis tools, and algorithms in machine learning to enable
deployment in more realistic applications.

Applications may be submitted by email to <tiark@purdue.edu> or <roopsha@purdue.edu>
