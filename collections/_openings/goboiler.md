For the summer of 2019 the GoBoiler internship program targets European
undergraduate students with specialization in Computing. Students who are
interested in research and curious about graduate studies at Purdue in Computer
Science will benefit most from this opportunity. Interns will be working closely
with a Purdue research team on cutting-edge projects. They will be involved in
the day to day life of a research lab and get to take part in all aspects of CS
research. They will also enjoy opportunities to socialize with graduate students
and explore Indiana in the Summer.
